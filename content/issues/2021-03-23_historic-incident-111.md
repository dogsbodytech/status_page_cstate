Our Wordpress hosting servers will be rebooted on Thursday between [20:00 and 23:00 GMT on Tue 23rd Mar 2021](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210323T20&p1=1440&ah=3) to install a number of critical updates. These include general performance improvements, enhancements to networking throughput, and a BIOS upgrade.

A three-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 30 minutes.

**Update 21:30:** This work is starting now.

**Update 21:45:** This work has been completed without issue.
