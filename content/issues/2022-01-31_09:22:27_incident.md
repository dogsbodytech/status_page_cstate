We are currently tracking an outage affecting our WordPress and support e-mail systems which started at 08:32 this morning. This seems to be a networking fault in the datacentre hosting our infrastructure. The services aren't completely offline however a lot of requests are being rejected.
<br />
<br />We have raised an issue with the datacentre hosting your server and are are awaiting a reply. We are tracking a large number of issues with servers in this datacentre so we imagine they are already working on a resolution.
<br />
<br />We'll update you when we have more information

***Update*** {{< track "2022-01-31T09:52:00+00:00" >}}
The Datacentre has replied with: "An issue was impacting IPv6 connectivity in our London data center was identified starting at ~8:22AM UTC. This issue has since been corrected as of ~9:33AM UTC. We will be monitoring this to ensure that it remains stable".


***Resolved*** {{< track "2022-01-31T10:00:00+00:00" >}}
We are happy that all systems have returned to normal. We did identify issues affecting IPv4 as well as IPv6 however this may well have been systems failing over to IPv4.
