We will be completing planned maintenance on the Purple server between [17:00 and 19:00 UTC on Sun 21st Dec 2014](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20141221T17&ah=2). to upgrade PHP to v5.4.35.<br /><br />We are not anticipating any downtime however the webserver will be restarted which may cause an outage of a few seconds.<br /><br />If you have any issues with your site after the upgrade then please contact us as soon as possible.
