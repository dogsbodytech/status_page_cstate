We will be upgrading PHP on the Purple server between [16:00 and 17:00 UTC on Fri 6th May 2016](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20160506T16&p1=1440&ah=1).<br /><br />We will be upgrading to the PHP 5.5.34 security release in order to protect websites hosted on this server against attack.<br /><br />We have tested this upgrade and are not envisaging any issues, but services may be unavailable for a few seconds whilst we perform the upgrade.<br /><br />Please take this opportunity to make sure any CMS software you are using is fully up to date in order to protect your site and ensure youâ€™re making the most of the latest features.
