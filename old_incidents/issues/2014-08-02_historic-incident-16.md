We will be upgrading PHP on the Purple server between [21:00 and 22:00 UTC on Sun 10th Aug 2014](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20140810T20&ah=1).<br /><br />We will be upgrading the server to PHP v5.4.31 which is required to support some of the latest CMS products being released.<br /><br />We have fully tested this upgrade and donâ€™t anticipate any issues however this may affect people running old scripts written for older versions of PHP.<br /><br />Please take this as an opportunity to check the version of any CMS system you are using (such as Wordpress or Joomla) and make sure you are using the latest version.  This is required for the security of your site as well as giving you the latest features.<br /><br />N.B We will be starting to audit sites on our shared servers next month and will be contacting any users that are running old/insecure sites.
