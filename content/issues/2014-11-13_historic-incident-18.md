We will be completing planned maintenance on the Purple server between [20:00 and 22:00 UTC on Sun 23rd Nov 2014](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20141123T20&ah=2).

We are not anticipating any downtime however some services will be restarted which may cause outages of a few seconds.

Planned work…

*    Upgrade OS to (security patches have already been installed)<br />*    Upgrade PHP from v5.4.31 to v5.4.33<br />*    Roll out stronger default encryption settings for HTTPS as well as SSL connections used for FTP and email (SMTP, IMAP & POP3).

This change to SSL settings **may** cause issues with older computers connecting to our services.  If you have any problems at all please contact us and we’ll find the best way forward.
