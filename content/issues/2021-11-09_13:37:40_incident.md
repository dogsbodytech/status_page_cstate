Our Wordpress hosting servers will be rebooted on Thursday between [08:00 and 12:00 GMT on Tue 23rd Mar 2021](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+WordPress+Hosting+server+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20211111T08&p1=5823&ah=3) to install a number of critical updates. These include general performance improvements and security enhancements.

A three-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 30 minutes.
