Our cPanel hosting servers will be rebooted between [22:00 and 23:59 BST on Wednesday 21st Dec 2022](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+cPanel+Hosting+server+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20221221T22&p1=5823&ah=2) to install a number of critical updates. These include important security enhancements. A two-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 15 minutes.
