Dogsbody Technology continuously monitors the health of our equipment and weâ€™ve been alerted to a condition which affects the physical server on which our customers WordPress sites are hosted. While we have determined that this is not an emergency, this should be addressed in order to optimize the performance of the server.

We have scheduled a maintenance window for the server: [Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:00 AM UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20160916T03&ah=1)

Downtime from this maintenance is expected to be no more than 1 hour. Please note, however, that the entire maintenance window may be required.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning this maintenance window.
