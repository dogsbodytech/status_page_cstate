Customers on our WordPress will be migrated to new servers between [20:00 and 22:59 UTC on Sun 26th May 2019](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20190526T20&ah=3).

This update will roll out an updated version of PHP as well as a speed increase for all sites.  All sites have been tested to the best of our ability.

Each site should only experience an outage of around 20 minutes while each server is migrated.

**Update 21:53:** This migration as now been completed without issue
