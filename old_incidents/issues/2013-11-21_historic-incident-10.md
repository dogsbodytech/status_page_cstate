We have identified an issue with users accessing email (POP3, IMAP & SMTP) via SSL.<br /><br />Users may see SSL warnings to say that the certificate expired today.  We can assure you that the certificate has been renewed. <br /><br />This will only affect users that send or collect email via SSL.<br /><br />**Update:** This issue has now been fixed. All email will have remained encrypted at all times.
