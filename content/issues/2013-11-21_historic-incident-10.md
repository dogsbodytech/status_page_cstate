We have identified an issue with users accessing email (POP3, IMAP & SMTP) via SSL.

Users may see SSL warnings to say that the certificate expired today.  We can assure you that the certificate has been renewed. 

This will only affect users that send or collect email via SSL.

**Update:** This issue has now been fixed. All email will have remained encrypted at all times.
