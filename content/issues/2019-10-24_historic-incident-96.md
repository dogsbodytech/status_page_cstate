Our Wordpress hosting servers will be rebooted Friday between [00:01 and 02:00 UTC on 25th Oct 2019](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20191025T0000&p1=1440&ah=2) to reload a new kernel.

A two-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 30 minutes.

**Update 01:15:** This work has now been completed without issue.
