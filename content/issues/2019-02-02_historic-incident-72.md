The SSL certificates used by the server have been updated in the following contexts...<br />- Control Panel<br />- Webmail<br />- SMTP<br />- IMAP<br />- POP3

... while this should not cause any issues we have had reports in the past of old email clients that required restarting to accept the new certificate.

Please feel free to contact us shout you have any other issues.
