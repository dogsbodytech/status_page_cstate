Our cPanel hosting servers will be rebooted between [09:00 and 12:00 UTC on Sat 1st Jun 2019](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20190601T08&ah=3) to load new a new kernel.

This update patches the recent ZombieLoad vulnerability that meant that a local attacker could escalate their privileges on the system.

The outage should only last around 5 minutes while the systems reboots.

**Update 9:04** This work is starting now.

**Update 9:17** This work has been completed without issue.
