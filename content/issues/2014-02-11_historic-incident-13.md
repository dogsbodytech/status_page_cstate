We are getting high packet loss to our orange and purple servers.

Initial investigations show this is a networking issue with our upstream provider.  A ticket has been raised and we continue to investigate.

**Update:** We have now received the following from our upstream provider…


>This evening at approximately 1AM we were the target of a significant DDoS attack, approximately 75Gbit/s in size.
<br />
> <br />
>As a result, many upstream connections were affected and this would have caused some level of packet loss for clients, ranging from minor to extreme, for approximately 30 minutes. Depending on where users connect to your service from would depend on whether they were affected. <br />
> <br />
>Our group’s network and infrastructure team were alerted to identify the destination of the attack, which was null-routed as soon as the target could be identified. Given the size of the attack and activity on social networking sites, we believe it was organised by a team of professional attackers who also claim to have taken down some very large organisations this evening.<br />
> <br />
>We are intensively monitoring the network traffic to ensure there is no recurrence.<br />
> <br />
>We sincerely apologise for the interruption to service for any customers affected and you can be assured we will continue to do everything we can to mitigate the effects such attacks have for clients.
