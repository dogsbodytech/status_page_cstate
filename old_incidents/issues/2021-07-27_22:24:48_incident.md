We currently have intermittent connectivity issues to our email and wordpress hosting servers. 

::: update Ongoing | 2021-07-27T21:37:00+01:00
This apears to be an issue with connectivity between the datacentre hosting these servers and the rest of the internet. We are already discussing options with them and will place workarounds in place as soon as possible.

Things seem to have returned to normal. We will continue to observe things overnight.

::: update Confirmed | 2021-07-27T23:11:00+01:00
The datacentre have confirmed that they had a transit provider that was passing traffic on damaged fiber.  They have now routed their network around the issue.
