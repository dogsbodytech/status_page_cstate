<!-- Status updates below this line -->
Our Wordpress hosting servers will be rebooted on Thursday between [08:30 and 10:30 BST on Thur 22nd Jul 2021](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210722T0730&ah=2) to install a number of critical updates. These updates patch vulnerabilities that meant any unprivileged user who exploited it could gain root privileges on the vulnerable host and any unprivileged user could exploit this vulnerability to crash systemd and the entire operating system.<br /><br />A three-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 30 minutes.
