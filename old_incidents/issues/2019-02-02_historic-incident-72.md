The SSL certificates used by the server have been updated in the following contexts...<br />- Control Panel<br />- Webmail<br />- SMTP<br />- IMAP<br />- POP3<br /><br />... while this should not cause any issues we have had reports in the past of old email clients that required restarting to accept the new certificate.<br /><br />Please feel free to contact us shout you have any other issues.
