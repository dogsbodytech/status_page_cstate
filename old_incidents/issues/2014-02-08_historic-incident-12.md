We will be upgrading the servers orange and purple over the weekend of 15-16 Feb 2014.<br /><br />*    Orange will be upgraded at 23:00 on Sat 15 Feb 2014<br />*    Purple will be upgraded at 23:00 on Sun 16 Feb 2014<br /><br />Services will be upgraded one by one and take around 30 minutes.  We will then take the opportunity to reboot these servers to load a new Kernel which will take all sites offline for around 3 minutes.
