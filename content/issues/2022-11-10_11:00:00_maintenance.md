We are migrating our E-mail infrastructure and have taken the decision to do this work during the day to keep our services as online as possible.

Emails to and from Dogsbody Technology may be delayed during this time. No e-mail will be lost.

We will continue to monitor systems and do not rely on e-mail to be notified of issues.

***Starting*** {{< track "2022-11-09T11:03:00+00:00" >}} We are starting this work now.

***Complete*** {{< track "2022-11-09T14:00:00+00:00" >}} This migration is complete and e-mail is now flowing normally again. Theer may still be e-mail held on servers we don't control which will come in over the next 2 hours

***Resolved*** {{< track "2022-11-09T16:00:00+00:00" >}} We are happy that the backlog of e-mails have been processed and everything is working as expected.
