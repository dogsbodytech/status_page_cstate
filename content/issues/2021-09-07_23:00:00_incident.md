The Datacentre that hosts our cPanel servers will be carrying out core network upgrades. Customers may see a small period of disruption whilst services are moved between pairs of equipment. All connections that are being worked on are part of redundant pairs. All customers should consider their services to be “at risk” for the entire duration of the maintenance window



Our network engineering team will be moving services within the site between our current platform and our new 100G Cisco platform.



The maintenance work has been split into multiple nights to allow for a controlled and careful move of circuits between the devices with adequate time for testing of each moved connection and any rollbacks that may be required. We will be performing the maintenance on the nights 6th - 10th September 2021, beginning at 23:00 (BST) on each night and finishing at 04:00 (BST) the following morning.



All of the work will be completed by our experienced network and datacentre team.



As with any upgrade or maintenance work there is an increased risk to services. Customers may experience a brief period of service disruption as services fail to a redundant path. All customers should consider their services to be “at risk” for the entire duration of the maintenance window.
