We have been slowly migrating users from our old Yellow server to our shiny new Purple server and planned to complete this work in June. 

Unfortunately the Yellow server has developed a fault which means we need to expedite up the migration which will now be done over the next three days.

No email will be lost in the migration however email may be delayed while it finds itâ€™s way from the old server to the new one.

We apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Please do contact us if you find any issues with your site or email after this time.
