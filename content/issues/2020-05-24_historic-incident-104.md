Our WordPress hosting servers are showing timeouts on some pages and others are slow to respond.  We are Investigating.

**Update: 18:52** We have identified that a very large number of WordPress sites are being attacked from a very large number of sources.  This is very hard to automatically differentiate from legitimate traffic.  We are attempting to manually identify a commonality.

**Update: 19:12** The attack continues but we are happy that we have mitigated the worst of it. We will continue to monitor and block traffic as required.

**Update 20:09** We are continuing to block attacks and monitor the situation however we are happy that sites are up and responding.

**Update 21:18** Traffic has returned to normal and all systems are nominal again.
