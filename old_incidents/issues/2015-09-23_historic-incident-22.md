We will be completing planned maintenance on the Purple server between [20:00 and 21:00 UTC on Mon 28th Sep 2015](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150928T20&ah=1) to upgrade PHP to v5.4.45.<br /><br />We are not anticipating any downtime however the webserver will be restarted which may cause an outage of a few seconds.<br />If you have any issues with your site or the control panel after the upgrade then please contact us as soon as possible.
