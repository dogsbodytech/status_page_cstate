We will be completing planned maintenance on the Purple server between [20:00 and 22:00 UTC on Wed 19st Aug 2015](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150819T20&ah=2) to upgrade PHP to v5.4.44 and BlueOnyx to v5208R.

This upgrade will require that the server be rebooted which will cause an outage of around 3 minutes at some point during this window.

BlueOnyx 5208R brings a whole new control panel to the server which may take some getting used to but there are handy helpers throughout that should point you in the right direction.

If you have any issues with your site or the control panel after the upgrade then please contact us as soon as possible.
