Users of our yellow.dogsbodyhosting.net server may have noticed delayed incoming email today.<br /><br />We have identified the issue which was caused by a DNS server migration that had an unintended knock on change to our mailserver.<br /><br />Mail was affected between 11:44 and 16:20 on Tue 4th Dec 2012.  <br /><br />No mail should have been lost and mail will continue to come back in to your inboxes over the next hour.
