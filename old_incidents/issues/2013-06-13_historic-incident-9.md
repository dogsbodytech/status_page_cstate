We have been slowly migrating users from our old Yellow server to our shiny new Purple server and planned to complete this work in June. <br /><br />Unfortunately the Yellow server has developed a fault which means we need to expedite up the migration which will now be done over the next three days.<br /><br />No email will be lost in the migration however email may be delayed while it finds itâ€™s way from the old server to the new one.<br /><br />We apologies for any inconvenience caused.<br /><br />Please do contact us if you find any issues with your site or email after this time.
