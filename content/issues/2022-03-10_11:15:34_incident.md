Our Wordpress hosting servers will be rebooted on Thursday between [07:00 and 12:00 GMT on Saturday 12th Mar 2022](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+WordPress+Hosting+server+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20220312T07&p1=5823&ah=5) to install a number of critical updates. These include important security enhancements. A five-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 30 minutes.
