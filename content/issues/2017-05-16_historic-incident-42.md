We are currently experiencing issues with our incoming mail server.  Customers may find emails to us are delayed.

**Update: 15:47** -  The ISP that hosts this server had a temporary routing issue.  We are watching the issue to ensure the problem doesn't return.

**Update: 16:38** -  Systems have been running without issue for an hour.  Downtime was only 3 minutes.  Closing this incident.
