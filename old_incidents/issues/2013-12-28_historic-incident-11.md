We are utilising the Christmas break to migrate the orange server to a new IP address range. This will add additional capacity as well as allowing us to start adding IPv6 services.<br /><br />The migration will occur between 20:00 and 23:59 on Sat 28th Dec 2013.<br /><br />No customers will be affected however access to our website (dogsbodyhosting.net & dogsbodytechnology.com) maybe limited and emails to us maybe delayed during this time.
