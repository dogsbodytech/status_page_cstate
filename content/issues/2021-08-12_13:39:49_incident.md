Our cPanel hosting servers will be rebooted on Sunday between [20:00 and 23:00 BST on 15th Aug 2021](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210815T1900&ah=3) to install a number of critical updates. These updates patch vulnerabilities that meant any unprivileged user who exploited it could gain root privileges on the vulnerable host and any unprivileged user could exploit this vulnerability to crash systemd and the entire operating system.

A three-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 15 minutes.
