We will be completing planned maintenance on the Purple server between [20:00 and 22:00 UTC on Wed 19st Aug 2015](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150819T20&ah=2) to upgrade PHP to v5.4.44 and BlueOnyx to v5208R.<br /><br />This upgrade will require that the server be rebooted which will cause an outage of around 3 minutes at some point during this window.<br /><br />BlueOnyx 5208R brings a whole new control panel to the server which may take some getting used to but there are handy helpers throughout that should point you in the right direction.<br /><br />If you have any issues with your site or the control panel after the upgrade then please contact us as soon as possible.
