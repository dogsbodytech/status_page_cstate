<p>Our datacentre has informed us of some emergency maintenance work on part of their core network infrastructure...</p>

<p>"Our engineering team will work with Cisco TAC to re-introduce a core switch back into service. The switch was removed from service earlier today and is now ready to be returned to active service. All the work will be completed by our Network Team in tandem with Cisco TAC and Data Centre technicians. We advise customers to plan for some intermittent network interruption during the window. We will work to keep this to a minimum, but we do expect some short periods as the network converges to bring the spine back into service."</p>
