Slack has advised that [customers are experiencing degraded functionality](https://status.slack.com/2019-04/cd8c3560451f0724) on their service.  

We haven't actually noticed any issues ourselves but suspect that issues maybe affecting customers differently. We are still [contactable via phone and email](https://www.dogsbody.com/contact/) if required.

**Update: 09:55** This issue has now been resolved.
