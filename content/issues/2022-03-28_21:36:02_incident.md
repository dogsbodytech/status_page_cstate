At 19:24 we were notified that sites on our WordPress hosting were running slowly. 

***Investigating*** {{< track "2022-03-28T19:52:00+01:00" >}}
We have identified that one of our security partners responsible for checking the security of our customers sites is being a little over zelous and is causing very high load on the infrastructure.


***Monitoring*** {{< track "2022-03-28T21:19:00+01:00" >}}
We have taken the decision to block traffic from our security partner in order to get sites running at their ultimate speed again.  This has returned sites to normal.


***Resolved*** {{< track "2022-03-28T21:49:00+01:00" >}}
All systems are back to normal now, but we're monitoring closely. In this case our own protection bit us. Our partner was not rate limited like normal traffic was and so managed to case this issue. We will be changing this setup during our next maintenance window.
