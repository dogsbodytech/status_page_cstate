The Indigo server will be rebooted Thursday between [05:00 and 06:00 UTC on Thu 18th Jan 2018](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20180118T05&ah=1).

This update will patch the much publicised Meltdown vulnerability on our servers host system.

The outage should only last around 5 minutes while the systems reboots.
