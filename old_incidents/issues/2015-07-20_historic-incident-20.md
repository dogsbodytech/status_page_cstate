We will be completing planned maintenance on the Purple server between [21:00 and 22:00 UTC on Wed 22nd Jul 2015](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150722T21&ah=1). to upgrade PHP to v5.4.42.<br /><br />We are not anticipating any downtime however the webserver will be restarted which may cause an outage of a few seconds.<br /><br />If you have any issues with your site after the upgrade then please contact us as soon as possible.
