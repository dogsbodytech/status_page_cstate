We are currently tracking an outage affecting our WordPress Hosting and support e-mail systems which started at 22:38 this evening (UK Time). This seems to be a networking fault in the datacentre hosting our infrastructure. All services are completely offline.

The datacentre is already aware of the issue and working on a resolution. 

We'll update you when we have more information
