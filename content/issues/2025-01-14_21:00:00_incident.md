Our Plesk hosting servers will be rebooted on Tuesday between [21:00 and 23:00 GMT on Tuesday 14 Jan 2025](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+Plesk+Hosting+server+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20250114T21&p1=5823&ah=2) to upgrade them to a larger size. A two hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 10 minutes.
