Our Wordpress hosting servers will be rebooted on Wednesday between [21:00 and 23:59 BST on Wednesday 17th Aug 2022](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+WordPress+Hosting+server+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20220816T21&p1=5823&ah=3) to install a number of critical updates. These include important security enhancements. A three-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 30 minutes.
