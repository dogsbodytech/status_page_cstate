It seems users on the Purple server cannot login to collect mail or update their sites.  It is suspected that this is caused by an upgrade done at 19:37 last night.

Update 11:31: We can confirm that the PAM (Password Authentication Module) configuration on the server was broken using last nightâ€™s upgrade.  We have now fixed this issue and apologise for any inconvenience caused.  No email will have been lost during this outage.
