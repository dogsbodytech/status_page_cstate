We were alerted to an outage with our WordPress hosting services between 13:24 and 13:30 UK time.

A number of malicous IPs were scanning sites causing increased resource usage.
Our ratelimiting automatically detected and blocked these IPs, bringing resource usage back to normal resolving the issue.
