Our WordPress hosting servers will be rebooted between [07:00 and 08:00 BST on Thursday 27th April 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+WordPress+Hosting+servers+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20230427T07&p1=5823&ah=1) to install a number of critical updates. These include important security enhancements. A one hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 15 minutes.
