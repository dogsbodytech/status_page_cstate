Between [16:35 and 20:35 BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20190919T15&ah=5) email to our old domains (dogsbodytechnology.com and dogsbodyhosting.net) may have bounced. This was due to a error while migrating between systems and has now been corrected.  E-mail to our main domain (dogsbody.com) was not affected.
