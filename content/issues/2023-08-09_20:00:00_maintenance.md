Our cPanel hosting servers will be rebooted between [20:00 and 23:59 BST on Wednesday 09th Aug 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reboot+of+cPanel+Hosting+server+-+Scheduled+Maintenance&iso=20230809T20&p1=5823&ah=4) to install a number of critical updates. These include important security enhancements. A four-hour window is allocated. However, the actual downtime is typically less than 15 minutes.
