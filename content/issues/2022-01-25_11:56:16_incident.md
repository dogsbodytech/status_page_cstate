The datacentre hosting these services will be performing network maintenance on Tuesday 18 January 2022 from 00:00 (UTC) until 03:30 (UTC). During this window, they will be performing code upgrades on some networking equipment. While they do not expect any downtime, a brief period of increased latency or packet loss may occur.

We detected a networking outage between 00:33 - 00:39 UTC this morning and only affected networking (mainly IPv6 but some IPv4). We are happy everything has returned to normal now.
