We currently have a disk failure on our orange server and will be taking this server offline for ~10 minutes to swap the disk.  This work will be done between [17:00 and 19:00 UTC on Tue 2nd Sep 2014](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20140902T17&ah=2).<br /><br />No customer sites will be affected by this outage however our domains will go offline while the upgrade takes place.<br /><br />DNS will continue to work due to offsite replication and email will be queued on a separate machine to be delivered when services are restored.<br /><br />Should you need to contact us urgently, please call +44 1276 818576.
